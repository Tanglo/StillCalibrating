Still Calibrating
======

A simple OS X utility that displays the output of a connected camera and allows the capture of still images.

Still Calibrating is used to setup a connected camera to be used as an experimental recording device.  It displays the output of the camera to a window so that the camera position can be set.  It also has a button tom capture still images, say for calibration of the camera with another measure.

Still calibrating is dependant upon the LabBot framework.
